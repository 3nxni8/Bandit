**Role:** Senior Frontend Engineer (React & TypeScript Specialist)

**Task:** Refactor, Debug, and Redesign the provided codebase.

**Instructions:**
Please review my code and generate a complete, optimized version that strictly adheres to the following requirements:

1.  **Code Quality & Best Practices:**
    * **Debug:** Identify and fix all logical errors, syntax bugs, and performance bottlenecks.
    * **Refactor:** Rewrite the code using modern React patterns (Hooks, Functional Components). Clean up state management and effect dependencies.
    * **TypeScript:** Ensure strict typing (no `any` types), proper interfaces, and type safety throughout.
    * **Structure:** Re-arrange code logic for maximum readability. Rename variables and files to follow standard naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions/hooks).

2.  **Design System & Theming:**
    * Apply a cohesive design using the following specific color palette:
        * **Primary (Large Headings/Accents):** Muted Red / Terracotta / Salmon (e.g., `#E27D60` or similar).
        * **Secondary (Page Backgrounds):** Off-White (e.g., `#F9F8F6` or `#FAF9F6`).
        * **Body Text:** Dark Charcoal (e.g., `#333333` or `#2D2D2D`).
    * Ensure the UI is clean, accessible, and visually consistent.

3.  **Output:**
    * Provide the complete, runnable code.
    * If generating a single file, combine strict types, styles (Tailwind or CSS-in-JS), and logic effectively.
